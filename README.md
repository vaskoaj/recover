#Data Recovery

This program was created in order to recover .jpg images from a memory card that was erased.

The program scans through the card looking for JPEG images by looking for the JPEG specific initiation sequence.

This program assumes that once the first image is found, the subsequent images are stored back-to-back. This is a reasonable assumptions for most digital cameras.
